<section id="verification"><h2>Obtaining extended licence</h2>
<p>According to the agreement with SFR System manufacturer, to complicate unauthorised base unit programming and competition vandalism, 
one willing to obtain his first <b>short-term extended</b> license should provide proof of SFR readout unit ownership.</p>
<p>To provide a valid proof, please send an image with "SFR Reader" text and SFR readout unit (<a href="../images/sample.jpg">sample</a>) to the srgttv@gmail.com.</p>
</section>

<section id="read"><h2>Reading card data</h2>
<p>With NFC turned on, just tap smartphone to the card to read data.</p>
<p>If this does not work, make sure the card is located near the NFC antenna zone. Some devices have it at unexpected places such as top edge.</p>
<p>Tapping against the same card for the second time would show message "The data are already read".</p>
</section>

<section id="connect"><h2>Assigning athlete's name</h2>

<p>SFR Reader allows setting team/athlete's name to each result it reads.</p>

<p>One can set it manually after each reading operation, or in semiautomatic and even fully automatic way. 

To speed the process up one can <a href="#upload">upload list of athletes</a> from a text file (UTF-8 encoded) or SFR Smart Terminal, or SFR Event Centre database, to choose the correct name from the list.
If the ahtlete in the list has a card number, then SFR reader would automatically use that name for the card.</p>
<p>You can use Excel or any similar program (Open / Libre Office) to prepare the list and save it as CSV-file.</p>

<a href="names.txt">Sample</a>:
<pre style="background-color: #f0f1f2 !important; padding: 0.5rem;">
// Line starting with 2 slashes is a comment.
// The file format is trivial: 
// One line&nbsp;&mdash; one team

// These teams should be  
// chosen manually
The Furious
Just walking
Quantum snails

// For the following teams
// SFR Reader would use
// card #32 for Swamp kids, 
// and card #34 for John Doe.
// Text befor semicolon is a card number, 
// text after it is a team name.

31;Chasing daylight
32;Swamp kids
33;Humpty Dumpty
34;John Doe
35;Heather Jones
36;Salmon - 1
37;Cheetah - 7</pre>

</section>

<section id="upload"><h2>Athlete list upload</h2>
<p>To import list of participants upload file to the smartphone (via e-mail, messenger, USB or Bluetooth) choose "Load teams..." menu item and find uploaded file.</p> 

<p>SFR Reader would display the number of uploaded teams and proceed to the teams list or show an error message for ill-formed files.</p>
</section>

<section id="courses"><h2>Courses</h2>
<p>SFR Reader supports creating, edititng of the courses of different types like regular, rogaine, other scoring type and some mixed variants.
To start editing the course choose "Courses" menu item, or just swipe right.</p>

<img src="../images/stage_en.png" class="rounded float-right" alt="stage settings" width="216" height="330"/> 
<p>Each course consists of at least one stage (the only one usually). Every stage has a type (regular, rogaine, choice), a set of control points, and some other parameters like time limit, 
minimum number of control points, late period and late penalty (for rogaine type).</p>

<p>Mixed courses contain several stages of regular and choice types. It's impossible to mix stages of rogaine and other types in one course, since rogaine result is counted in points,
 while other types use time and number of visited control points.</p>

<p>The first stage may contain "Start" control point, and the last stage&nbsp;&mdash; "Finish" control point. In such a case "Start" and "Finish" punches would define athelete's total time.
In case there would be no "Start" or "Finish" control points in the course, the first (last) punch at the athelete's card would be used as "Start" ("Finish") punch.</p>

<p>The punches "Start" and "Finish" are not accounted, when validating, whether the athlete visited required number of control points (i.e. athlete with "Start", 31 and "Finish" punches is considered to visit 1 control point, not 3.)
The athletes, who visit less control points than stage's minimum (if any), get DSQ result, with a comment "Too few control points".</p>

</section>

<section id="course"><h2>Result validation</h2>
<p>If there is a course defined, SFR Reader validates each result, and uses it to show and sort results in a proper way.</p> 
<p>Result is considered valid, if all stages of the course are passed. The stage is considered passed, if all required CPs are visited (for regular stages&nbsp;&mdash; visited in the correct sequence) 
and stage time limit is not exceeded (exceeded for no more than grace time for rogain stages).</p>

<p>Possible results are OK (all the stages are passed, no time limits are boken) and different variants of DSQ:</li>
<ul>
<li>Too Few Control Points&nbsp;&mdash; the first stage failed is of regular type, and not all of it's CPs are visited in correct sequence, or first failed stage is rogain or scoring type stage, and the athlete 
		has visited less then minimum required number of CPs</li>
<li>Time limit&nbsp;&mdash; time limit is exceeded for the first failed stage</li>
<li>DNF&nbsp;&mdash; the course has "Finish" control point, but there are no such punch in an athlete's card</li>
<li>DNS&nbsp;&mdash; the course has "Start" control point, but there are no such punch in an athlete's card</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For every athlete's card read SFR Reader provides general results: total time, and number of visited CPs (points earned), and details: lists of missed CPs, false CPs visited,
 duplicate CPs for rogain or other scoring type courses.</p>

<p>If the course is changed somehow: CP is added or removed, time limits or even course type is changed, then SFR Reader would revalidate all stored results.</p>
</section>

<section id="baseunits"><h2>Base unit programming</h2>
Base units are programmed in 3 steps using a master-card.<br/>
<ol>
  <li>Choose what to program</li>
  <li>Tap the phone to the card</li>
  <li>Tap the base unit to the card</li>
</ol>
Average programming time is less than 1 second.
</section>

<section id="hardware"><h2>Hardware requirements</h2>
SFR Reader works on smartphones and tablets running OS Android ver.&nbsp;4.2 and higher with 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Field_Communication" class="text-secondary" target="_blank"><u>NFC</u></a> technology support. On devices without NFC SFR Reader's abilities are limited to showing main screens.
</section>

<section id="known"><h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>Some smartphones are known to have very slow NFC data transfer (1-2 seconds per 1 punch, instead of regular 30-100 msec).</p>
<p>The problem models are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alcatel POP 4S (5095Y)</li>
  <li>Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (D5803)</li>
  <li>Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact (SGP621)</li>
</ul>
